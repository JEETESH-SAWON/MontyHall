# Monty Hall Simulation (Spring Boot + Thymeleaf)

This project is a simulation of the **Monty Hall Problem**, built with **Spring Boot**, **Thymeleaf**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

The application performs **10,000 iterations** to analyze the win rate of two strategies:
- **Switching** doors after one is revealed.
- **Staying** with the original choice.

It then displays the **percentage of wins** for each strategy using a **bar chart** and **text summary**.

## üöÄ Features

- Backend powered by **Spring Boot**
- Dynamic HTML rendering with **Thymeleaf**
- Simulation logic: runs 10,000 games per request
- Strategy comparison: switch vs. no switch
- Visual results with **JavaScript-powered bar chart**
- Responsive layout with **CSS**

## üß™ Monty Hall Logic

1. Three doors: behind one is a car, behind the others are goats.
2. User picks a door.
3. Host (who knows the contents) opens one of the other two doors to reveal a goat.
4. User either:
   - **Stays** with the original door, or
   - **Switches** to the remaining unopened door.
5. The result is recorded.
6. Repeat 10,000 times to calculate percentages.

## üìä Example Output

After running the simulation, the app displays:

- Percentage of wins if the user **switches** doors
- Percentage of wins if the user **does not switch**
- A **bar chart** comparing both strategies visually
